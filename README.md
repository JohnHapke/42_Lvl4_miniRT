# miniRT - A Basic Ray Tracer Implementation

## Purpose
> The purpose of the miniRT project is to create a C program that implements a functional ray tracer, providing hands-on experience with 3D mathematics, light physics, and computer graphics algorithms. The program demonstrates understanding of ray-object intersection calculations, lighting models, and image rendering while implementing core ray tracing functionality.

## Explanation of Behavior
miniRT implements a functional ray tracer that generates realistic 3D images. The program:

- Parses scene description files (.rt format) containing geometric objects and lighting information
- Calculates ray-object intersections for spheres, planes, and cylinders
- Implements ambient and diffuse lighting models for realistic shading
- Handles object transformations (translation and rotation)
- Generates hard shadows and proper light interactions
- Renders images in real-time using the MiniLibX graphics library
- Provides interactive window management with proper event handling

## How It Works
### Initialization
The program starts by:

- Parsing the scene description file (.rt format)
- Setting up the MiniLibX graphics library
- Initializing the camera, lights, and geometric objects
- Creating the rendering window

### Ray Tracing Pipeline

- **Scene Parsing**: Reads and validates the .rt file containing scene elements (ambient light, camera, lights, objects).
- **Ray Generation**: For each pixel, generates a ray from the camera through the pixel into the scene.
- **Intersection Calculation**: Tests ray intersections with all objects in the scene (spheres, planes, cylinders).
- **Lighting Calculation**: Applies ambient and diffuse lighting models to determine pixel color.
- **Shadow Calculation**: Traces shadow rays to determine if objects are in shadow.
- **Image Rendering**: Displays the final rendered image in the MiniLibX window.

### Core Features
**Supported Geometric Objects**

- `Spheres` - Defined by center point and diameter
- `Planes` - Defined by a point and normal vector
- `Cylinders` - Defined by center, axis vector, diameter, and height

### Lighting System

- `Ambient Lighting` - Global illumination preventing complete darkness
- `Diffuse Lighting` - Directional lighting based on surface normals
- `Hard Shadows` - Sharp shadow casting from light sources
- `Multiple Light Sources` - Support for multiple point lights

### Scene Elements

- `Camera` - Viewpoint position, orientation, and field of view
- `Ambient Light` - Global lighting ratio and color
- `Point Lights` - Position, brightness, and color
- `Objects` - Geometric primitives with position, orientation, and color

### Transformations

- `Translation` - Moving objects, lights, and camera in 3D space
- `Rotation` - Rotating objects and camera (spheres and lights cannot be rotated)
- `Scaling` - Adjusting object dimensions (diameter for spheres, width/height for cylinders)

## Scene File Format (.rt)
The program accepts scene description files with the following format:
```bash
A 0.2 255,255,255                              # Ambient lighting
C -50,0,20 0,0,1 70                            # Camera
L -40,0,30 0.7 255,255,255                     # Light
pl 0,0,0 0,1.0,0 255,0,225                     # Plane
sp 0,0,20 20 255,0,0                           # Sphere
cy 50.0,0.0,20.6 0,0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,255  # Cylinder
```
